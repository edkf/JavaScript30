    // Let's say we have an array

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // This overrides the main arr
    // const players2 = players;
    // players2[3] = 'Ed';

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const players2 = players.slice();
    players2[3] = 'Ed';

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const players3 = [].concat(players);
    players3[3] = 'Mayra';

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const players4 = [...players];
    players4[3] = 'Vanderson';

    const players5 = Array.from(players);
    players5[3] = 'ZÃ©';

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    const person = {name: 'Edgard', age: 24};


    // and think we make a copy:

    // This overrides the main obj
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 90;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // const captain2 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
